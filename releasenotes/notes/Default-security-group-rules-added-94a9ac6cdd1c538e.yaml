    New API which allows to define own set of the security group rules used
    automatically in every new ``default`` and/or custom security group created
    for projects.
upgrade:
  - |
    During upgrade process set of 4 default security group rules will be created
    in the Neutron database. Those rules are the same as default rules added to
    every new security group up to now:

      * rule to allow all egress IPv4 traffic (for all default and custom
        Security groups),
      * rule to allow all egress IPv6 traffic (for all default and custom
        Security groups),
      * rule to allow all ingress IPv4 traffic from the same security group
        (for default security group in each project),
      * rule to allow all ingress IPv6 traffic from the same security group
        (for default security group in each project).

    Those rules can now be modified by cloud administrator using
    ``default-security-group-rules`` API.
